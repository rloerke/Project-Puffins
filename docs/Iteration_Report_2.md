## Iteration 2 Report

## Responsibilities

1. Adding testing and accessibility features
   - Ray
   
2. Account Creation
   - Rayaan
   
3. Delete posts function
   - Nick
   
4. Edit posts function
   - Jake
   
## Progress

- Ray completed all his planned work, and everything works perfectly.
- Jake also finished his code and believes the function should work, but is running into some weird error that needs Professor Liffiton's help
- Nick completed 90% his work for delete function, but since the log in/log out function is not yet implemented, he cannot create a feature to delete posts with matching User ID and post ID. We have the basic delete working, but any user is allowed to delete any post currently, but in the next iteration, only users that have same user ID and Post ID will be able to delete the post.
- Rayaan has also done 95% of the work on account creation, just needs some troubleshooting with Professor Liffiton's help

## Not Completed

No major features have been left incomplete, but Jake and Rayaan just need to troubleshoot and fine-tune.
The only thing not yet added is the aforementioned feature in Nick's work, which is dependent on login/logout and will be done in a future iteration


## Difficulties Encountered

As mentioned, Jake ran into some unexpected problems that can't be understood just yet, and Nick was having trouble connecting the delete function to the database

## Useful Tool

Version control software was very helpful in keeping track of changes and merging our work.

## Important thing we learned

-The use of Werkzeug security functions and the importance of user authentication was a new and useful tool for both this and the next iteration.
