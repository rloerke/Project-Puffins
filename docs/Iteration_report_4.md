- Ray successfully adapted the website to use bootstrap elements and also corrected the functions.
- Jake successfully added a user profile page where you can see the post of the user logged in and also corrected the functions.
- Raayan was ill and was unable to complete he objective for the week

## Not Completed

- As mentioned above, the reactions were unable to be completed.
- On a different note, relating to the upvote down vote system, it works but a user is able to upvote or down vote as many times as they want. We are going to address this in the future. 

## Difficulties Encountered

-Some initial struggle with getting all of a single users posts to show on their profile page but eventually solved.

## Useful Tool

-A useful tool this week was the ability to view the sql tables in live time. 

## Important thing we learned

-One important thing we learned this week was the importance of communication again. Coming off of last week when we vowed to communicate more, we still need to be better as we did not find out about Rayaan until late in the week.
