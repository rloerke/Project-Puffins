## Progress

All the responsibilities were completed. A main layout html file and main page view html file for viewing posts was created.
A style css sheet was created to for these templates. The schema.sql file was updated with our working idea of a database. 
And the app.py was updated to allow for the viewing and creation of posts.

## Not Completed

All features we wanted to add were completed. Everything could be refined but working versions were created.
There are also some issues in our code that we need to fix. 


## Difficulties Encountered

There was some confusion about what each person was supposed to be working on and how exactly the site will function. 
We worked through these issues and cleared up any confusion in our group chat. 

## Design Adjustments

We discussed how comments should work and how they will be identified in the database. A new comment was added to the schema file to reflect this conversation. 

## Useful Tool

Version control software was very helpful in keeping track of changes and merging our work.
