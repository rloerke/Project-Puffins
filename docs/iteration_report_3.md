## Iteration 3 Report

## Responsibilities
1. Adding the user profile page
   - Jake
   
2. Post comments, viewing comments
   - Ray

3. Correct Delete Function, then Filtering Posts
   - Nick
   
4. Authentication/logging in or out
   - Rayaan
## Progress

- Nick's responsibilities of correcting the delete function and filtering functions are complete.
- Ray's responsibilities of adding comment posting and viewing are complete
- Jake's responsibilities of adding the user profile page are currently incomplete, as the user profile page will not be functional until Rayaan fixes the issues within his functions for logging into an account.
- Rayann finished created the login and logout function, but is having trouble with recognition of multiple users.  This is to be discussed further with Prof. Liffiton.  This functionality needs to be fixed in order for the user profile page to work as intended.

## Not Completed

- There are issues with the login and logout functions, which in turn prevent the user profile page from functioning as intended.

## Difficulties Encountered
- We had a few issues regarding git and pushing our commits properly but this has since been resolved.

## Useful Tool

Version control software was very helpful in keeping track of changes and merging our work.

## Important thing we learned
- It would be beneficial for us to meet more often during this upcoming week.
